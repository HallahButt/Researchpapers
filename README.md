# Research papers
My name is Hallah, and I am doing my PhD in Machine Learning from KIT, Germany, a project of Helmholtz AI. My research area is reinforcement learning (RL), explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and its applications in the energy domain. If you want to learn more about it, you can look into the following papers. 

- [Why Reinforcement Learning in Energy Systems Needs Explanations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648505.3648510)
- [Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Electricity Costs in Building Energy Management](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rWaubpmAXNjrObb3LOjIhPJN9LMNumqg/view)
